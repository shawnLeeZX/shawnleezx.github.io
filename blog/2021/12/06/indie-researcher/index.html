    <p>This is an article in the series of “what is an intellectual life”. It
is written to explore the current intellectual landscape, and to
understand where human civilization is heading. This is a revised
version of an early draft to which the first paragraph is added, and
thus do be surprised that why ChatGPT is discussed by a 2021 post :).</p>

<p>Independent researcher is a rather foreign concept under Chinese
context, and thus one of the major reason to write this post is to
explain this concept to the Chinese audience, meanwhile to
contextualize the author’s experience of doing independent blue skies
research.</p>

<p>However, the message in this post is beyond individual experience. In
our times, the air that science is beacon of humanity has been
gone. Therefore, this post aims to clarify how science was done in its
good old days, when science was the beacon of hope in the
Enlightenment era. And what it looks like nowadays if one wants to do
something similar—independent researcher might be one of the few
structural options.  This is a shortened version of a longer essay
given at <a href="/essays/indie">Independent Blue Skies Research and Its Chinese
Particulars</a>.</p>

<h3 id="blue-skies-research">Blue skies research</h3>

<p>To begin with, we shall explain what we mean by blue skies research,
and a systematic exposition could be found in the longer essay
previously. To explain it, we have a miraculous contemporary example
now: the discovery of ChatGPT.</p>

<p>In an interview with Ilya Sutskever, the interviewer asked what
surprised him the most in his journey of working out ChatGPT. Ilya
said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>perhaps it was neural network works at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To understand such a surprise, is to understand blue skies
research. And we need to go back to the Geoffrey Hinton’s days. In a
few earlier academic conferences, Hinton would retell the dark days of
neural network research: before the Deep Belief Network paper, neural
network is considered a “dirty” word, and Hinton was told by
conference organizers that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>we do not publish papers on artificial neural network;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>we already have one paper on neural network, and we do not need
another one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The exact phrases might be slightly different as quoted, but the message
is there.</p>

<p>The Imagenet moment started with Ilya’s speculative ideas that what if
we scale the dataset and model up? Neural networks do not work might
because they are way too small. In cooperation with Alex Krizhevsky,
who is among the first to apply GPU acceleration on neural networks,
they managed to scale both the network up for the first time with CUDA
programming, and won the ImageNet competition of 2012 with a large
margin over the second place.  This started a new era of Computer
Vision.</p>

<p>Then, the progress of Deep Learning is the stories of visionaries made
big bet on scale. AlphaGo is the bet of DeepMind’s founders on large
scale deep reinforcement learning, in which Ilya was also involved.
and ChatGPT was the outcome of the exploration of Ilya’s idea: what if
we keep scaling the model? Then, next-world prediction was the only
task that has massive amount of data and could be trained in a
self-supervised way. Even when GPT-2 showed great promise, and the scaling
law of transformers had been discovered, it was not clear what the
path would lead if we keep scaling the model up: it would take
millions of dollars to train GPT-3.</p>

<p>And eventually, Sam Altman the Resourceful, Greg Brockman the
Architecture, and Ilya Sutskever the Visionary, managed to push
through, and discovered ChatGPT.</p>

<p>This is a typical process of blue skies research. It was the efforts
of multiple generations of scientists: before Ilya, there was Hinton;
before Hinton, there was McCulloch and Pitts (who built the first
model of neural networks that led to the current model).</p>

<p>Blue skies research is scientific research in domains where
“real-world” applications are not immediately apparent. It is closely
related to basic research, but with some subtle difference. Basic
research is a type of scientific research with the aim of improving
scientific theories for better understanding and prediction of natural
or other phenomena, and the impact of basic research has been rather
well understood: it leads to major advance in technology in the
decades ahead. Therefore, building giant particle colliders to
investigate theoretical physics would be basic research, and its
utility has been supported by societal progress delivered by the
century of theoretical physics beforehand. However, blue skies
research are research like theoretical physics at the turn of 20th
century, where it is not clear at all that the investigation of the
black body emission would lead to quantum physics, and there would be
no justification, a rational argument beforehand, or even awareness of
the possibility of the undertaking—it could be considered to be too
difficult to be possible, or an issue that is not aware by most people
(e.g., climate change in 1970s).</p>

<p>The life cycle of those major discoveries from blue skies research to
industrial products tends to be punctuated by steps separated by five
to ten years. The previous narratives are the exciting ones, and
before that, neural network has roughly been through 70 years of
lesser known research that punctuated by those kind of steps. And this
is somehow how almost all big discoveries are made.</p>

<p>However, this sounds so different from what research is carried over
nowadays, when it was applauded that a researcher could publish a
dozen papers a year, and Ilya also said in his
<a href="https://youtu.be/Ft0gTO2K85A?t=664">interview</a> that summarizes the
current academia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the goal is to discover small bits of knowledge, sharing it with
other researchers, and getting scientific recognition as results; it
is a very valid goal, and is very understandable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the new generations, this seems to be the norm of academia, and
for Chinese scientists, this is perhaps things always are. However,
this is some ill-adaptation or institutionalization of academia, and
the leadership is being aware of its damage: see the idea of <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/2020/02/26/time-to-rethink-the-publication-process-in-machine-learning/">slow
science</a>.</p>

<p>This norm of academia is a gradual businessization and
bureaucratization of the academic system since the emergence of
academic military complex, and further discussion could be found at
the <a href="/essayes/indies">essay</a>, and we would not delve too deep into
them here. And the real progress typically happened outside the
system—even Hinton was an outsider of the academia before the Deep
Learning revolution.</p>

<p>If we look back into the past, we could see that blue skies research
is typically how science always progresses.</p>

<h3 id="science-in-the-enlightenment-era">Science in the enlightenment era</h3>

<p>In its early stage, practicing science, which then was known as
natural philosophy, was a hard way to earn a living and an easy one
for making enemies.</p>

<p>Those early seekers continually moved
from court to court and university to university, living a vagabond
life. Then, Universitas, a Latin word from which University is derived, referred to
the group of teachers in the cathedral school who set up with a few
students a place for higher education, and self-governed like a
guild. And the courts were a federation of feudal lords nominally under the
leadership of the Christian papacy. The courts wanted magic,
predictions and later weaponry, the universities polemical
teaching. These traveling salesmen in ideas were not philosophers in
the sense of pale meditators tied to a desk, yet they managed to write
an incredible number of books, often not published till after their
death but widely circulated in manuscript.</p>

<p>This was the case of the
most extraordinary character of the first half of the 16th century.
The more known character is Giordano Bruno, who was protected by the
princes and cities for his skill in magic—which then was to see and utilize
patterns unnoticed by average people through natural philosophy—until
they could not, and was burned at the stake by Inquisitors. The lesser
known Telesio, whose work of 1565, <em>On Nature</em>, led Bacon to
call him “the first of the moderns”. Those pioneers are less known
than their youngsters because the first, who struggle out of the
establishment and form new and useful conceptions, only appears half
right, incomplete, and remote in this history of ideas, but they
perhaps more to be cherished than those who come after, who clear off
the debris and offer a neater, more fullblown view</p>

<p>And this is a repeated pattern not only in the history of ideas, but
also in the history of science, though in a less dangerous fashion. As
a way of seeing, science ultimately became intertwined with the
establishment for different regions for a period of centuries, or
decades (as the tempo sped up), and the pioneers who saw the new light
were oozed from the system, by apathy, vested interests or simply
ignorance, because it is a disposition of human’s nature to cling to
the time-proven way of living and to be repugnant of change.</p>

<p>In the
early Renaissance, Erasmus was a vagabond hopped among universities
and royal patrons, deliberately avoid funds that would curb his
independence (though he sometimes regretted it in hard times) while
writing the translation of Bible that unified the Greek and the Latin
traditions of the New Testament.  In early
Enlightenment, Spinoza was excluded from the Jewish community, had
been expelled by Amsterdam municipal authorities, and made a living by
giving private philosophy lessons and grinding lenses, while working
as an independent scholar writing <em>Ethics</em> (which published
posthumously) among other works. In early Industrial revolution, Sadi
Carnot, the father of thermodynamic, was employed as a General Staff
in Paris, on call for military duty, but from then on he dedicated
most of his attention to private intellectual pursuits and received
only two-thirds pay. He died unfortunately because of cholera epidemic
at the age of 36 at 1832, and his work was rediscovered by Kelvin in
1853.
As well known, in early Modernity, Einstein could not secure an
academic post after graduation, and worked as a patent worker outside
the academics before he worked out the theory of relativity. Bertrand Russell spent his 20s living on
his inherited money and in an isolated life for 10 years writing
<em>Principia Mathematica</em>, which started the analytic philosophy
in revolt to the German idealism. And
Godel could not find a job after obtaining his doctorate, yet attended
the meeting of Vienna Circle regularly and proved the Incomplete
Theorem. Even during the times between the
WWII and 1980s when we might call the golden times of science,
complexity science started in a similar way: Brian Arthur grayed his
hair while advocating the concept of positive feedback in economics;
Langton had worked hourly jobs, both as a carpenter with a home
remodeling company and as an assistant at a stained-glass shop, while
developing his prototypical ideas that started the field
<em>Artificial Life</em>; and Stephen
Wolfram needed to start to a company to publish <em>A New Kind of
Science</em>.</p>

<p>To start something fundamentally new, the road is hard and long
because the evidence is sparse, the benefits are obscure, and the old
systems were good—they had consistency, completeness, and proven
access to material abundance; only at a few points did contrary facts
or gaps in explanation threaten their validity. None of the pioneers
were in ”suitable” places where important works were supposed to
happen.</p>

<p>To appreciate the timeline of science advances, we could look at the
example of computer science. In addition to the technological
advances, the theoretical foundation of computer science, Turing
Machine, was the accumulated result of almost a century’s effort. It
started with Gottlob Frege, who reworked logic in the middle of 19th
century, and was widely considered to be the greatest logician since
Aristotle, though he was largely ignored during his lifetime. Giuseppe
Peano, Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein continued the effort
and tried to rework the foundation of mathematics and even philosophy—
which led to analytic philosophy—through logic.  The effort ultimately
led Kurt Godel of the Vienna Circle to prove that logic formal system
is not self-consistent. The result inspired Alan Turing to investigate
what is reducible to logic and what is not, and led to the concept
what is computable and what is not, which is the Turing Machine. This
process roughly took a century. Similar timelines hold for statistical
physics, quantum physics, theories of relativity, and perhaps all
the branches of science.</p>

<p>None of them publish many papers, and the Turing Machine paper gets
rejected many times.</p>

<p>The granularity of such developments of research of this significance
is decades; even if the current information society could accelerate
the information propagation, it could not accelerate the genesis of
ideas, which are the concentrated efforts of individuals or small
groups that span 5-10 years, interlock with one another, and
accumulate into a breakthrough in decades. This is so obvious when one
takes the effort to looks into the history of philosophy and science.</p>

<h3 id="science-in-the-chinese-context">Science in the Chinese context</h3>

<p>In our times, because of the business and economic impact of science,
research has become an organized effort, and thus this type of blue
skies research (when it could happen) is intertwined with incremental
research in the academia and industrial commercial oriented
research—those are the funding that supports Ilya’s work until
ChatGPT could be worked out.</p>

<p>However, the situation in China is more chaotic and difficult.  The
science system in China was built under deep pragmatism for national
rejuvenation under severe resource and time pressure; as a
consequence, it only takes what has been proved working, and thus
inherits the problem of the institutionalized science ecosystem
without the structural vestige left by the early Enlightenment
thinkers.</p>

<p>As a result, the Chinese science takes the role to develop commercial
or economic oriented science in the global science ecosystem. The role
to build original 0-to-1 blue skies research is predominately played
by the Western system.</p>

<p>Consequently, the main stream science consists of mostly commercially
driven incremental research, and there is almost no zero-to-one
original research happening for both historical and structural reason.</p>

<p>For people who decides to do blue skies research, the road is long and
hard.  An exemplar would be Yitang Zhang, who took precarious jobs for
7 years—as an accountant, a delivery worker for a New York City
restaurant, also in motel in Kentucky and in a Subway sandwich
shop—then a lecturer for 14 years, before he made world-renowned
advance in mathematics.</p>

<p>The problem needs to be understood in the historical dynamics of
China. The research system aims to train advanced technicians and do
applied research to support the economy. Under this context, the goal
of publication for the majority of students is not to push the
frontier of science, either applied or basic, but to demonstrate that
they are familiar with the literature, such that they could be hired
as a technician who is capable of being abreast with the international
state of the art. Meanwhile, the applied nature of the research
requires that the research should be directly related to the relevant
economical sectors, and thus the research areas that align with the
national plans would get funded, and that not would struggle to find
support.  Therefore, the researchers are a body of knowledge workers
employed by the states to serve an economic function, and blue skies
research is structurally not fit for this system.</p>

<p>The institutional support for Ilya in the Western system does not
exist under the Chinese context. If we say that the Westerner
scientists could play the easy mode of blue skies research, the
Chinese scientists have to play the hard mode of Renaissance
thinkers.</p>

<p>A more in-depth discussion is given in the full <a href="/essays/indie">essay</a>,
and interested readers is referred there.</p>

<h3 id="blue-skies-research-and-independent-researcher">Blue skies research and independent researcher</h3>

<p>Now we could discuss the typical characteristics of blue skies
research, and how it is related to independent researchers.</p>

<p>This type of research typically goes through four phases: a
preparation phase where a great amount of prerequisite training are
undertaken; a hermit-gestation phase where individuals concentrate a
stretch of period to work in isolation, synthesize previous
experiences, and work out a proof of concept; a monastery-order phase
where a critical group is formed to polish the proof of concept;
lastly, a society-engagement phase where the result is disseminated
and ultimately leads to societal impact. Despite the
institutionalization of the Western science ecosystem, institutional
support for independent research during the four phases are
tenaciously maintained.</p>

<p>But for researchers get their early education in Mainland China, even
if they are educated and work in the Western system later on,
institutional support does not exists for the first two phases.
Except for isolated lucky cases, structurally and statistically, in
the preparation phase, the researchers have to work first as an
apprentice to accumulate knowledge and experience, and then as a
contracted worker throughout a series of contracts in the preparation
stage instead of as an institutionally supported researcher
undertaking independent inquiry (e.g., Prize Fellow in Cambridge
University, or Harvard Society of Fellows)—this nostalgically
resembles the experience of Enlightenment thinkers, who need to move
from university to university, and court to court to trade magic,
prediction, tutorship for patronage. And the gestation phase that
requires high concentration of energy and time is very hard to
accommodate in the system, and being independent researcher might be
the few structural options to have.</p>

<p>All those discussions roughly summarize what independent researchers
are: they are features of science’s progress. This concept basically
means people who work on something that do not have ecosystem support
yet in the society—it could start a new ecosystem when it
works. Many of them achieve nothing, but most major discoveries come
from this way.</p>

<p>After the miracle of ChatGPT, independent research has become more
systematically promoted than they were previously, and there are more
institutions are funding independent researchers:
<a href="https://openai.com/blog/superalignment-fast-grants">OpenAI</a>, and
<a href="https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future">Long Term Future
Fund</a>, to give a
few examples, though this is also mostly a Western phenomenon.</p>

<p>Those kinds of independent research are like mutations that make the
system evolve, and this evolution happens in the monastery-order phase
and the societal-impact phase that follow the gestation phase—recall
that universities and research institutes were mostly transformed from
monasteries in the Middle Age—though this topic would be topic of
another day.</p>
