<p>This is Shawn W. M. Li. I figure that I am an intellectual, working on
understanding the fundamental questions: why intelligence exists, and
how such understanding could build technologies and institutions
to nudge the society onto a better evolutionary trajectory (which
necessarily implies understanding what is a better society). I am
currently a senior R&amp;D engineer at Baidu Inc.; I am helping build a
group to work under the theme of embodied intelligence, specifically
focusing on the alignment of large language model for the time
being—details given on <a href="#research--development">Research &amp;
Development</a> on this page.</p>

<p><em>Advertisement</em>: We are hiring for all levels of researchers and
engineers, and interns. A great fit would be one who appreciates
that science is an epic invention of humanity where truth could be
found by hypothesizing and experimenting, and technologies are
instruments of societal progress (or in other words evolution) that
remakes the fundamental relation of production. In prehistory, similar
phenomena have been mythologized: Adam and Eve ate Apple of Wisdom;
Prometheus stole Fire; and Icarus flew into the sky with wings made
with feathers and wax. I am trying to make the point less a cliche by
being sophisticated, and putting it more plainly, we hope to find
like-minded people who have a love for science and technologies, and
the business impact of artificial intelligence gives an unusual
ecological niche amid societies of capital, states, conflicts, and
progress—some appreciation might also be needed for difficulties and
subtleties in working on science and technologies among the current
state of our world.  Please do contact me if you are interested.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>I had formal background in mathematics, science, design and
engineering, and have been working with machine learning system (e.g.,
Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning)
in large-scale distributed settings with love of GNU, Linux and Emacs
for more than 10 years. I got a Bachelor degree in Computer Science
from the <em>Special School for Gifted Young</em> at <em>University of Science
and Technology of China</em>, and a Master of Philosophy degree in
Electronic Engineering from <em>Chinese University of Hong Kong</em>. I got
trained in innovation and design at Global Engineering Design
Innovation program at <em>Stanford University</em>, and <em>MIT</em>
Entrepreneurship and Maker Skills Integrator. I experienced academia
by interning at <em>Microsoft Research Asia</em>, working as an associate
researcher at <em>South China University of Technology</em>, and publishing
on topics (e.g., Deep Learning and Statistical Learning) at top-tier
avenues, e.g., <em>TPAMI</em>. I am also perhaps knowledgeable in most
disciplines, e.g., physics, history, economics, or philosophy.</p>

<h3 id="research--development">Research &amp; Development</h3>

<p>The following introduces the current significant directions that I am
working on.</p>

<h4 id="science-of-intelligence">Science of intelligence</h4>

<p>Previously, I have spent about 10 years investigating
first-principle derivation of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs),
crystallizing the ideas in two papers—<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/5814935">a letter</a> introducing the
main ideas, and a more <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/5814961">technical article</a>. The
basic idea is that deep neural networks (DNNs) are a phenomenological
model of biotic intelligence, and DNNs could be studied similarly to
physics through symmetries, though the symmetries here are not
conservative symmetries in physics, but a symmetry perhaps that might
form a different paradigm, and is referred as <em>adaptive symmetry</em>. The
learning process could be formalized as a symmetries-breaking process
where these symmetries are broken to build a model of the world that
could predict the future, such that the uncertainty of survival and
reproduction is decreased; that is, to adapt to the world. More
technically, there exists concentration of measures phenomena for
large DNNs that enable learning of the network to stay within a phase
where arbitrary learning errors could be reduced. That is, biotic or
cognitive complexity arises from adaptive-symmetries breaking.</p>

<h4 id="embodied-intelligence">Embodied intelligence</h4>

<p>The adaptive-symmetries breaking work sets the first step, or
foundation, for the subsequent efforts. More specifically, the
previous works analyze the simplest yet most fundamental setting,
i.e., object classification; it is conceptually clean, yet fundamental
intelligence arises from a being embodied in an environment whose
survival requires daily feedback and decisions on what actions to
take.</p>

<p>Therefore, currently, in the sense of large themes, I am working on
something we might call <em>embodied intelligence</em>. More specifically, the
current breakthrough of large language model (LLM) is such a
uncertainty-reducing system in a semantic word worlds; the system is
trained by minimizing perplexity, another word for uncertainty. It is
a fitting setting to study embodied decision intelligence. For example, there
are two major problems.  First, next-word prediction might be
understood as something that might be called instincts, and it lacks
long-range decision capability to be truly useful as an competent
assistant (e.g., JARVIS in the film Iron Man). This ability is
currently still nascent (e.g., elicited by techniques such as
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback).  Second, natural words
are already coarse-grained (in other words, semantic) information
packet of the words, and thus predicting next-word sidesteps the
problem of building coarse-grained abstraction of the world from raw
signals (e.g., pixels). A system that could be call general
intelligence in the physical world (e.g., autonomous robots) needs
somehow to have a mechanism to build abstractions from raw signals,
and the current LLM paradigm lacks this.  Those two problems are
major challenges to realize the transformational impact of artificial
intelligence on societies.</p>

<h4 id="alignment">Alignment</h4>

<p>These aforementioned problems overplay with the more specialized field
of <em>alignment</em>. Instead of the common denotation of “aligning”
catastrophic superintelligence, alignment might be more like finding
the right formalism of interaction between the environment (e.g.,
Internet) and the model/agent. Currently, neither LLM or end-to-end
control systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles) have a mechanically clear
(which implying interpretable) algorithm, a reliable training
procedure, robust behaviors to adversarial inputs, or scalable access
to feedback from environments. As a result, LLM has trouble making
correct decisions with long-chain reasoning, and autonomous vehicles
have poor generalization capacity. Therefore, we are currently working
on, for example, more reliable, robust and scalable alignment methods.</p>
