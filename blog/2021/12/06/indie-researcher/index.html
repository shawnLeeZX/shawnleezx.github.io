  <div class="content post-content container" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This is an article in the series of “what is an intellectual
life”. This is a revised version of an early draft that adds the
example of ChatGPT. The post is to discuss the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_scientist">independent
researcher</a>.</p>

<p>This might not be a strange concept generally, but it might be the
case in the Chinese context. To summarize, independent researchers are
structural features of science’s progress, and perhaps are the agent
of blue skies research. Here “structural” should be understood as
follows. Every now and then, a system needs something fundamentally
new; and those new ideas typically start at the edge of the system,
where different main stream ideas are mixed. Because those ideas are
new-born, they do not have ecosystem support yet in the society—it
could start a new ecosystem when it works. Therefore, they typically
do not have institutional support for some time, and they are
self-funded or take some blue skies grant.</p>

<p>The coexistence of indie researchers and academic societies is a
general pattern in the history of science, and in the following, we
break this down step by step.</p>

<h3 id="blue-skies-research">Blue skies research</h3>

<p>To begin with, we shall explain what we mean by blue skies research,
To explain it, we have a miraculous contemporary example now: the
discovery of ChatGPT.</p>

<p>In an interview with Ilya Sutskever, the interviewer asked what
surprised him the most in his journey of working out ChatGPT. Ilya
said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>perhaps it was neural network works at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To understand such a surprise, is to understand blue skies
research. And we need to go back to the Geoffrey Hinton’s days. In a
few earlier academic conferences, Hinton would retell the dark days of
neural network research: before the Deep Belief Network paper, neural
network is considered a “dirty” word, and Hinton was told by
conference organizers that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>we do not publish papers on artificial neural network;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>we already have one paper on neural network, and we do not need
another one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The exact phrases might be slightly different as quoted, but the message
is there.</p>

<p>At the earlier days of artificial neural network research, the idea
that a cartoon mimic of biological neural system could produce
meaningful intelligence is considered not even as a serious
science—to clarify, we shall not delve too much into the past, and the
accumulation of this image also has its history.</p>

<p>The Imagenet moment started with Ilya’s speculative ideas that what if
we scale the dataset and model up? Neural networks do not work might
because they are way too small. In cooperation with Alex Krizhevsky,
who is among the first to apply GPU acceleration on neural networks,
they managed to scale both the network up for the first time with CUDA
programming, and won the ImageNet competition of 2012 with a large
margin over the second place.  This started a new era of Computer
Vision.</p>

<p>Then, the progress of Deep Learning is the stories of visionaries made
big bet on scale. AlphaGo is the bet of DeepMind’s founders on large
scale deep reinforcement learning, in which Ilya was also involved.
and ChatGPT was the outcome of the exploration of Ilya’s idea: what if
we keep scaling the model? Then, next-world prediction was the only
task that has massive amount of data and could be trained in a
self-supervised way. Even when GPT-2 showed great promise, and the scaling
law of transformers had been discovered, it was not clear what the
path would lead if we keep scaling the model up: it would take
millions of dollars to train GPT-3.</p>

<p>And eventually, Sam Altman the Resourceful, Greg Brockman the
Architect, and Ilya Sutskever the Visionary, managed to push
through, and discovered ChatGPT.</p>

<p>This is a typical process of blue skies research. It was the efforts
of multiple generations of scientists: before Ilya, there was Hinton;
before Hinton, there was McCulloch and Pitts (who built the first
model of neural networks that led to the current model).</p>

<p>Blue skies research is scientific research in domains where
“real-world” applications are not immediately apparent. It is closely
related to basic research, but with some subtle difference. Basic
research is a type of scientific research with the aim of improving
scientific theories for better understanding and prediction of natural
or other phenomena, and the impact of basic research has been rather
well understood: it leads to major advance in technology in the
decades ahead. Therefore, building giant particle colliders to
investigate theoretical physics would be basic research, and its
utility has been supported by societal progress delivered by the
century of theoretical physics beforehand. However, blue skies
research are research like theoretical physics at the turn of 20th
century, where it is not clear at all that the investigation of the
black body emission would lead to quantum physics, and there would be
no justification, a rational argument beforehand, or even awareness of
the possibility of the undertaking—it could be considered to be too
difficult to be possible, or an issue that is not aware by most people
(e.g., climate change in 1970s).</p>

<p>The life cycle of those major discoveries from blue skies research to
industrial products tends to be punctuated by steps separated by five
to ten years. The previous narratives are the exciting ones, and
before that, neural network has roughly been through 70 years of
lesser known research that punctuated by those kind of steps. And this
is somehow how almost all big discoveries are made.</p>

<p>This sounds markedly different from how research is carried over
nowadays, when it was expected that a researcher could publish a dozen
papers a year. To quote Ilya again in his
<a href="https://youtu.be/Ft0gTO2K85A?t=664">interview</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the goal is to discover small bits of knowledge, sharing it with
other researchers, and getting scientific recognition as results; it
is a very valid goal, and is very understandable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The current academic style of research might be detrimental to the
progress of science, and some further discussion could be found at
Bengio’s blog that promotes <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/2020/02/26/time-to-rethink-the-publication-process-in-machine-learning/">slow
science</a>.
However, This is also a deep topic, which we shall not delve into too
much.</p>

<p>In the following, we look back into the past, we could see that blue
skies research shares similar patterns to how science progresses in
the past.</p>

<h3 id="science-in-the-enlightenment-era">Science in the enlightenment era</h3>

<p>In its early stage, practicing science, which then was known as
natural philosophy, was a hard way to earn a living and an easy one
for making enemies.</p>

<p>Those early seekers continually moved
from court to court and university to university, living a vagabond
life. Then, Universitas, a Latin word from which University is derived, referred to
the group of teachers in the cathedral school who set up with a few
students a place for higher education, and self-governed like a
guild. And the courts were a federation of feudal lords nominally under the
leadership of the Christian papacy. The courts wanted magic,
predictions and later weaponry, the universities polemical
teaching. These traveling salesmen in ideas were not philosophers in
the sense of pale meditators tied to a desk, yet they managed to write
an incredible number of books, often not published till after their
death but widely circulated in manuscript.</p>

<p>This was the case of the
most extraordinary character of the first half of the 16th century.
The more known character is Giordano Bruno, who was protected by the
princes and cities for his skill in magic—which then was to see and utilize
patterns unnoticed by average people through natural philosophy—until
they could not, and was burned at the stake by Inquisitors. The lesser
known Telesio, whose work of 1565, <em>On Nature</em>, led Bacon to
call him “the first of the moderns”. Those pioneers are less known
than their youngsters because the first, who struggle out of the
establishment and form new and useful conceptions, only appears half
right, incomplete, and remote in this history of ideas, but they
perhaps more to be cherished than those who come after, who clear off
the debris and offer a neater, more fullblown view.</p>

<p>And this is a repeated pattern not only in the history of ideas, but
also in the history of science, though in a less dangerous fashion.</p>

<p>In the
early Renaissance, Erasmus was a vagabond hopped among universities
and royal patrons, deliberately avoid funds that would curb his
independence while
writing the translation of Bible that unified the Greek and the Latin
traditions of the New Testament.  In early
Enlightenment, Spinoza was excluded from the Jewish community, had
been expelled by Amsterdam municipal authorities, and made a living by
giving private philosophy lessons and grinding lenses, while working
as an independent scholar writing <em>Ethics</em> (which published
posthumously) among other works. In early Industrial revolution, Sadi
Carnot, the father of thermodynamic, was employed as a General Staff
in Paris, on call for military duty, but from then on he dedicated
most of his attention to private intellectual pursuits and received
only two-thirds pay. He died unfortunately because of cholera epidemic
at the age of 36 at 1832, and his work was rediscovered by Kelvin in
1853.
As well known, in early Modernity, Einstein could not secure an
academic post after graduation, and worked as a patent worker outside
the academics before he worked out the theory of relativity. Bertrand Russell spent his 20s living on
his inherited money and in an isolated life for 10 years writing
<em>Principia Mathematica</em>, which started the analytic philosophy
in revolt to the German idealism. And
Godel could not find a job after obtaining his doctorate, yet attended
the meeting of Vienna Circle regularly and proved the Incomplete
Theorem. Even during the times between the
WWII and 1980s when we might call the golden times of science,
complexity science started in a similar way: Brian Arthur grayed his
hair while advocating the concept of positive feedback in economics;
Langton had worked hourly jobs, both as a carpenter with a home
remodeling company and as an assistant at a stained-glass shop, while
developing his prototypical ideas that started the field
<em>Artificial Life</em>; and Stephen
Wolfram needed to start to a company to publish <em>A New Kind of
Science</em>.</p>

<p>To start something fundamentally new, the road is hard and long
because the evidence is sparse, the benefits are obscure, and the old
systems were good—they had consistency, completeness, and proven
access to material abundance; only at a few points did contrary facts
or gaps in explanation threaten their validity. None of the pioneers
were in ”suitable” places where important works were supposed to
happen.</p>

<p>To appreciate the timeline of science advances, we could look at the
example of computer science. In addition to the technological
advances, the theoretical foundation of computer science, Turing
Machine, was the accumulated result of almost a century’s effort. It
started with Gottlob Frege, who reworked logic in the middle of 19th
century, and was widely considered to be the greatest logician since
Aristotle, though he was largely ignored during his lifetime. Giuseppe
Peano, Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein continued the effort
and tried to rework the foundation of mathematics and even
philosophy—which led to analytic philosophy—through logic.  The effort
ultimately led Kurt Godel of the Vienna Circle to prove that logic
formal system is not self-consistent. The result inspired Alan Turing
to investigate what is reducible to logic and what is not, and led to
the concept what is computable and what is not, which is the Turing
Machine. This process roughly took a century. Similar timelines hold
for statistical physics, quantum physics, theories of relativity, and
perhaps all
the branches of science.</p>

<p>None of them publish many papers.</p>

<p>The granularity of such developments of research of this significance
is decades; even if the current information society could accelerate
the information propagation, it could not accelerate the genesis of
ideas, which are the concentrated efforts of individuals or small
groups that span 5-10 years, interlock with one another, and
accumulate into a breakthrough in decades. This is so obvious when one
takes the effort to looks into the history of philosophy and science.</p>

<h3 id="science-in-the-chinese-context">Science in the Chinese context</h3>

<p>In our times, because of the business and economic impact of science,
research has become an organized effort, and thus this type of blue
skies research (when it could happen) is intertwined with incremental
research in the academia and industrial commercial oriented
research—those are the funding that supports Ilya’s work until
ChatGPT could be worked out.</p>

<p>However, the situation in China is more chaotic and difficult. I will
try to describe the situation without sounding cynic. The science
system in China was built under deep pragmatism for national
rejuvenation under severe resource and time pressure; as a
consequence, it has been playing the game of catching up, and the
research done is mostly to build on previous works incrementally to
understand the field. Meanwhile, it mostly focuses on the part of
science that has practical benefits in short term.
As a result, the Chinese science takes the role to develop commercial
or economic oriented science in the global science ecosystem. The role
to build original 0-to-1 blue skies research is predominately played
by the Western system. Consequently, the main stream science consists
of mostly commercially driven incremental research, and there is
almost no zero-to-one original research happening for both historical
and structural reason.</p>

<p>In this system, blue skies research has very few institutional
support, and Yitang Zhang is a great example. Zhang has been the top
graduate of Peking University, and he has obtained his PhD in the
U.S.. After graduation, he was deeply motivated to study profound
mathematical problems. However, Zhang would rather take precarious
jobs in the U.S. than come back to China just because the tolerance of
all kinds of individual life choices in the West: Zhang took
precarious jobs for 7 years—as an accountant, a delivery worker for a
New York City restaurant, also in motel in Kentucky and in a Subway
sandwich shop—then a lecturer for 14 years, before he made
world-renowned advance in mathematics. This is an inspiring and sad
story from the Chinese system, but at the same time, reveals that as
a foreigner, he does not have access to the institutional support in
the U.S. for his research as well.</p>

<p>The institutional support for Ilya in the Western system does not
exist under the Chinese context. If we say that the Westerner
scientists could play the easy mode of blue skies research, the
Chinese scientists have to play the hard mode of Renaissance
thinkers.</p>

<h3 id="blue-skies-research-and-independent-researcher">Blue skies research and independent researcher</h3>

<p>Now we could discuss the typical characteristics of blue skies
research, and how it is related to independent researchers.</p>

<p>This type of research typically goes through four phases: a
preparation phase where a great amount of prerequisite training are
undertaken; a hermit-gestation phase where individuals concentrate a
stretch of period to work in isolation, synthesize previous
experiences, and work out a proof of concept; a monastery-order phase
where a critical group is formed to polish the proof of concept;
lastly, a society-engagement phase where the result is disseminated
and ultimately leads to societal impact. A more elaborate
<a href="https://sfiscience.medium.com/mountains-monasteries-and-the-metropolis-8192b3d02e6">discussion</a>
on the phases of science is given by the president of Santa Fe
Institute, David Krakauer, and it would be greatly recommended to
check it out—Santa Fe Institute is known as the Mecca of complexity
science, was set up by a number of Nobel Prize winners, and somehow
could be regarded as the continuation of the Los Alamos Lab in spirits.</p>

<p>The gestation phase perhaps is the most critical one, where few
guidance is available given that the territory is mostly uncharted,
and it is not clear whether the perceived program is significant in any
sense; consequently, it is a phase that stands between associate
research and fully grown research program. Meanwhile, support for
research mostly exists at the preparation phase and the
monastery-order phase in the form of jobs and funding—the
monastery-order phase is a typical university or institutional setting
(recall that monasteries are precursors to universities and research
institutions), or in modern days, industrial labs (whose support also spans
from the monastery-order phase and the societal-impact phase).</p>

<p>Recognizing this phenomenon, in each stage of a scholar’s career
cycle, the support for blue skies research has existed in varied
forms. In the early stage, the top prestigious institutions have
scholarship system that selects mainly based on researcher merit
instead of research proposal.  Cambridge University has its formidable
tradition of Prize Fellowship, where top graduate could be awarded
Prize Fellowship for several years to pursue whatever research
directions they are interested: Isaac Newton, Bertrand Russel, and
Stephen Hawk’s work were all supported by those fellowship; their
works were all unprecedented, and there were no faculties in Cambridge
could guide them, though some form of mentorship existed in the form of
senior fellows of Prize Fellowship. Harvard models its society of
fellow based on the Prize Fellowship of Cambridge. And in the later
stage, the institution of tenured professorship is to offer
institutional support for this type of inquiry. And there are funding
agents offer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_skies_research">blue skies research
grant</a> to people
who do not have access to those previously mentioned system: those
systems are path dependent, and are rather privileged choices.  For
example, after the miracle of ChatGPT, independent research has become
more systematically promoted than they were previously, and there are
more institutions funding independent researchers:
<a href="https://openai.com/blog/superalignment-fast-grants">OpenAI</a>, and
<a href="https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future">Long Term Future
Fund</a>, to give a
few examples.</p>

<p>However, as a sad story, to the best of my knowledge, those
institutional support does not exist in Mainland China, even if they
are educated and work in the Western system later on. Except for
isolated lucky cases, structurally and statistically, in the
preparation phase, the researchers have to work first as an apprentice
to accumulate knowledge and experience, and then as a contracted
worker throughout a series of contracts in the preparation stage
instead of as an institutionally supported researcher undertaking
independent inquiry (e.g., Prize Fellow in Cambridge University, or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Society_of_Fellows">Harvard Society of
Fellows</a>)—this
nostalgically resembles the experience of Enlightenment thinkers, who
need to move from university to university, and court to court to
trade magic, prediction, tutorship for patronage. And the gestation
phase that requires high concentration of energy and time is very hard
to accommodate in the system, and being independent researcher might
be the few structural options to have.</p>

<p>To see what it takes to break through this structural difficulties,
Yitang Zhang is an inspiration example previously that perhaps breaks
through the system through sheer will and brutal intelligence. Another
more well documented example would be Grigori Perelman, who is a
Russian, proved the century-problem of mathematics (Poincare
Conjecture), and shares a similar social-economic background. In his
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6684592-perfect-rigor">biography</a>,
the author documents a series of key figures in Grigori’s career who
gave him critical help that was extremely coincidental luck:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps the single most fateful incident in Perelman’s lifetime was
the appearance, in Perelman’s first year at Leningrad University, of
a larger-than-life presence in the form of a small old man with a
square gray beard. His name was Alexander Danilovich Alexandrov; he
was a living legend, and miraculously and almost ridiculously, he
was teaching geometry to first-year Mathmech students.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alexandrov to the Soviet Union could be simplistically understood as
Poincare to French, and at the year Grigori went to college, he was
coincidentally teaching first-year math after a series of political
events:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alexandrov risked his career—and ultimately lost his post as
university president—by supporting mathematicians who came under
attack for being either ideologically unreliable or Jewish.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alexandrov was fired as the president in 1964 and proceeded to spend
the next two decades in what still amounted to exile of the
not-entirely-self-imposed variety in Siberia, helping to create a
science town there. In his seventies, he returned to his university
with what turned out to be a vain hope of reclaiming a place there:
he wanted to fill a vacant chair in geometry. In the run-up to the
chair election, he taught a first-year course and charmed students
in part because of his openness about the absurdity of his
predicament.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without this series of support, independent researcher might be the
structurally unavoidable option.  Simplistically, each institution has
its life cycle: it started by certain research program that was a blue
skies research before, and matured when this program achieved its at
least initial goal. Individuals in the system need to align to the
goal to be able to find support. However, a new blue skies research
typically does not align with the goal very much. Thus,
being outsiders allows them to be free of the vested structural
 interests, manifesting as personal, political, historical and
 cultural constraints that exponentially slow down the progress, like
 10 times—and considering that the time frame of such work is
 typically minimally a few years’ concentrated effort, such slow down
 would make the work a few decades-long. In reality, quantitative
 difference would lead to qualitative change. This supposed
 decade-long program would mostly end up being impossible, and this
 impossibility manifests as the institutionalized thinking of
 individuals in the institutionalized systems, making breaking out of
 the box unthinkable. This is also why there is a myth that the
 creative energy of an individual exhausts before one’s thirties if
 one has not done anything notable, and the myth that a tenured
professor is a retired professor.</p>

<p>Hope that all those discussions capture what independent researchers
are: they are features of science’s progress. This concept basically
means people who work on something that do not have ecosystem support
yet in the society—it could start a new ecosystem when it
works. Many of them achieve nothing, but many major discoveries come
from this way.</p>
