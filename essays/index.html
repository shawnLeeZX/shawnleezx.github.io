These essays are written to not only to communicate, but also to
facilitate thinking (for myself, and hopefully for others as well),
and thus they are considered preliminary drafts. Feedback and comments
are welcomed, especially those could help better understand the topics
discussed in the essays, either by constructive discussion, or
criticisms.

      In our contemporary times, a spectrum of exciting and
      worrying technologies broadly known as Artificial Intelligence (AI)
      have demonstrated and continue to demonstrate the capabilities that
      were previously considered exclusively belonging to human. Meanwhile,
      the shortening of social-development's timescale, as a result of
      informatization and digitalization, speeds up the growth and
      exhaustion of economical sectors, manifesting as social crises (e.g.,
      job displacement) shown up seemingly randomly but regularly. As a
      result of the tribal instincts, the win and lose in these "crises"
      cause social polarization and resentment to the "other" group. The
      institutionalized individualism interprets the conflicts as
      ideological contest and is the receipt for disaster, and perhaps
      civilization collapse. Instead, the root of the problems is an
      epistemological wall that stands between humans and a science of
      society since the failure of logistic positivism to understand the
      limit of the knowable, which was the last straw that broke the spirit
      of Enlightenment that the world of men (and women) could be understood
      and managed through reason, and led to postmodernity. In this essay,
      we speculate that the yet-to-come science of AI might enable us to
      overcome this epistemological wall, and finally enable humans to
      understand and manage complex systems---which is an umbrella term for
      biotic, nervous, economical and social systems---and to approach a
      science of societies first fathomed by the Enlightenment thinkers.  In
      this essay, we would go through this journey from the Renaissance, and
      also the ancient China in the Bronze Age to our contemporary times to
      understand the current events. We also speculate the implications of
      this efforts of a science of societies: if this effort is successful,
      we might enter into an era that might be referred as the <em>Era
      of Planetarization</em>.

  <!--     Science and technology have become the cornerstone of -->
  <!--     contemporary societies, yet it is still underappreciated that what -->
  <!--     they are, how they progress, and how did we end up in the current -->
  <!--     state of affairs. As a result of this intellectual confusions, the -->
  <!--     role of universities and higher learning is confusing, which results -->
  <!--     in some distorted and ill-adapted institutes that are expected to -->
  <!--     serve the kaleidoscopic and ambiguous functions. This unawareness and -->
  <!--     confusion are a kind of norm throughout history of science or we could -->
  <!--     say philosophy, and the rare exceptions in history are the golden ages -->
  <!--     where some fundamental obstacles were cleared away, and an advancing -->
  <!--     direction had been clarified and supported by social-economical -->
  <!--     conditions. This essay is an attempt to make sense the obstacles in -->
  <!--     our contemporary times, and to discuss a specific problem on the -->
  <!--     dynamics of doing blue skies research (which simplistically could be -->
  <!--     understood as speculative science of Nobel-Prize potentials) generally, and the -->
  <!--     particulars in the Mainland Chinese science ecosystem (which includes -->
  <!--     the native ecosystem and its interaction with the international -->
  <!--     ecosystem through the Chinese diaspora). More specifically, this essay is written to -->
  <!--     clarify the structural characteristics of contemporary science, to -->
  <!--     make the experience of the author more intelligible, to share with -->
  <!--     other individuals who originated from the Chinese system and are -->
  <!--     attracted to blue skies research that there might still be pathways, -->
  <!--     despite the great difficulties---in summary, to do blue skies research -->
  <!--     under the Chinese context, one needs to sometimes be an independent -->
  <!--     researcher that is not dissimilar to the thinkers in the early -->
  <!--     Renaissance, which is immensely difficult, but fortunately still -->
  <!--     possible---perhaps also to explain to the wider international community -->
  <!--     this underappreciated difficulties of Chinese scientists, and lastly -->
  <!--     discuss contemporary transdisciplinary blue skies research in -->
  <!--     general.    </p> -->
