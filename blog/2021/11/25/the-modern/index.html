    <p>This is an article in the series of “what is an intellectual life”. It
is written to explore the current intellectual landscape, and to
understand where human civilization is heading. This is only an early
draft, and revisions are underway.</p>

<p>We are living in a bifurcation point of human history, and sadly or
excitingly, at the ending of an era. The era dawned at Renaissance,
and apexed at Enlightenment. Since then, the high and low tides of
reason manifested as interlacing ages as we know them by their
dominant philosophy, Romanticism, Positivism, Modernism, and
eventually died down into our times known as Postmodernism. The life
blood of reason is not merely the philosophical scaffold that it
provides for human mind, but more importantly in the eyes of the
general public, the individual empowerment and society betterment that
it delivers. But none of the two hold in our times: some segments of
the societies have already lived in material abundance yet still quest
for more but not sure of more of what, while some segments struggle to
survive in the world that was nominally made by reason; and reason in
the sense of logic has been proved by Incomplete Theorem of Godel as
not self-consistent, which if misleadingly stated, sounds like human
reason is not self-consistent. The intellectual havoc set off by the
theorem had killed off the logic positivism project of intellectuals,
put off the last hope in reviving the spirits of Age of Enlightenment
that human lives and societies could be intelligible and thus
humanistic order and a certain sense of progress is possible. And we
might say, this was the intellectual turmoil that underlied the World
Wars, Ideological Contests, Counter Culture, Disintegrating
Globalization, Climate Change, and the current geopolitical drama of
which the worst outcome would send humans again into another dark age.</p>

<p>However, despite the gradually dying down tides, something new was
quietly developing unnoticed by the general public. In the following,
we give a simplistic scaffold of the development, from the fundamental
to the practical.</p>

<p>The intellectual confusions of logic positivists have started being
understood. In <em>Probability: the Logic of Science</em>, E. T. Jaynes
describes another layer of mathematical structure underlying the
formal logic, probability, and discusses that the axiomatic
inconsistency identified by Godel is not an inherent property of
the proposition or event, but signifies the incompleteness of
information. And in <em>Being and Events</em>, Alain Badiou clarifies that
events are manifestation of hidden structure in things as they are,
and mathematics are the accumulating ontology from such events.</p>

<p>The mystery of life has been being understood. First, a series of
concepts to understand biotic life had been developed in the past
century: feedback-control loop in goal-directed behaviors in
Cybernetics, dynamic system in Self Organization, and edge of chaos
and complexity in Complex Adaptive System. A historical narrative
is given in <em>Keller, Evelyn Fox, Organisms, machines, and
    thunderstorms: A history of self-organization</em>. Second, Information
is becoming the another pillar of science among energy, matter, and
this triad, the concept of evolution that unifies the triad, and
the derivative concepts (e.g., complexity, organization, structure,
uncertainty reduction, slow timescale) has shed light into organic
matters. An edited contributions to summarize some of the progress could be found
in <em>From Matter to Life: Information and Causality</em>,
    and <em>The Philosophy of Information - An Introduction by
    The Π Research Network</em>. Third, the epistemology of
    physics has been clarified for biology, see <em>Perspectives
    on Organisms: Biological time, Symmetries and
    Singularities</em>.</p>

<p>An umbrella (though somehow misleading) concept, <em>Global Brain</em>,
that summarizes the current technological societal advancement and
globalization has been being developed for some decades. Edited
contributions to summarize the concepts are given in <em>H.
    Francis, L. Marta, The Global Brain as a model of the
    future information society: An introduction to the special issue</em>.</p>

<p>Informatization and digitalization have shortened the timescale to
gather data on social behaviors, and thus started to make
hypotheses on societies falsifiable; in other words, a science of
societies first envisioned by Enlightenment thinkers and then
Positivists is becoming possible. A glimpse into this possibility
could be found in <em>A. Buyalskaya et al. The Golden Age of Social
    Science</em>.</p>

<p>Lastly, to quote Marx, “the philosophers have only interpreted the
world, in various ways. The point, however, is to change it”.
Societies are intricate systems where the infrastructure and
institutions operates in a circular causality. And infrastructure
are the coarse-grained outcome of technologies over decades. Thus,
simplistically, social system evolution ultimately requires
fundamental progress in technologies (which itself again is the
outcome of progress in science, institutes, education, etc.). A
exposition of the idea might be found in <em>Kelly, Kevin,
    What Technology Wants</em>. We have reached a point where technology
could have powerful influence on social system within a career-time
of individuals.</p>

<p>The materials given previously should only be seen as seeds that are already
well known to demonstrate the concept, and a family of them, well
known or not, would grow and synthesize into an era that might be
called the Second Renaissance, the Next Enlightenment, and a more
descriptive name when the era matures, where a scientific humanistic
intellectual system (e.g., worldview, value system and destiny) of
human, societies, civilizations and universe could finally take shape
since the humanistic turn from theological intellectual system (in
Renaissance of Western Civilization and the Zhou Dynasty of ancient
Chinese Civilization). A foundation of this era likely would be a
scientific understanding of human mind, where speculatively
rationality and irrationality are two sides of the same coin, and
human mind is embedded in a unified understanding of biology,
phenomenology, psychology, logic-mathematics-probability-statistics,
sociology and cosmology. The technological derivation of this
foundation likely would lay the infrastructure for a different kind of
society similar to what the first industrial revolution did to the
previous mode of agricultural civilizations.</p>

<p>However, the process of such a transition would probably be prolonged,
both as a result of the intrinsic timescale of the science, and the
time needed by infrastructural and social-economical condition for
their development. There has been some very respectable calls for a
transition to new macro-economic models (e.g.,
<a href="https://internation.world/">Internation</a>, or <a href="https://greattransition.org/">Great Transition
Initiative</a>) to address the urgent
challenges of Anthropocene. And a decade would be long enough to see
the outcome of the climate change, the geopolitical struggle and many
other things. But intellectual argument and political mobilization
alone would not make the transition happen; perhaps not widely
acknowledged, human societies could only fundamentally restructured,
for better or for worse, when science and technology made
breakthroughs—“what has been will be again, what has been done will
be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.” Thus, the crisis
of climate change might scare the system to change cause, but the next
mode of society would not materialize without a positive framework
support by a different kind of productivity instruments, which what I
have in mind is the understanding of intelligence such that, for
example, they could be used to manage cities, biodiversity, and
provide robotic labors. And it is this kind of development
that would induce a new society, again, for better or for worse.</p>

<p>A demonstrative perspective into this era from the lens of Artificial
Intelligence (AI)—which does not merely refer to technology, but an
instrument to understand human mind and to build organic
societies—is given in the essay <a href="/essays/era">Era of Planeterization: Managing
Complexity with Intelligence</a>, but there should be a
family of instruments alongside this specific instrument of AI. A
sample of the instruments is given as follows: technology-wise,
hydroponics farming, nuclear fusion, planetary wind and solar energy
grid, cryptocurrency, autonomous robotics, smart cities, and quantum
computing; natural-science-wise, advance in the Theory of Everything
(e.g., string theory), panoramic landscaping regular update on
empirical biology, molecular science and material science;
social-science-wise, thematic trends, existing global issues (e.g.,
migration, poverty, gender), and the interface with public policy; and
also humanities and arts. It is not possible to track every details of
these areas, but the goal is to grok the fundamental assumptions,
concepts, trends and limitation of state of the art, and utilize and
push those instruments to develop a humanistic intellectual system
described previously and corresponding infrastructures to support
human ideals.</p>
